# phplib-football-data
Small library that implements some basic functionalities of football-data.org's API v2.

See the code in index.php on how to use the library, which should only serve you as a starting point. 

Setup a webserver and call the index.php in a browser. Afterwards check the code to see how these results are achieved.

Best,
daniel
